                        <strong>Welcome to BITNATION!</strong>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>“) explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by </p>

                        <strong>BITNATION GMBH Switzerland</strong>

                        <p>(d/b/a and hereinafter referred to as “<strong>Bitnation</strong>“).</p>

                        <p>This Policy applies to bitnation.co website. In processing its users’ personal data, Bitnation complies with this data privacy statement and all applicable statutory provisions, in specifically the Swiss Data Protection Act (Schweizerisches Datenschutzgesetz, DSG). </p>

                        <h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

                        <p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Services. For example, we collect information you provide to us when you register for an account, create a user profile, use our Contact Us form or otherwise communicate with us. Such information may include your name, email address, phone number, biographic information, social media handle, social media profile and/or website URL, picture and any other information you choose to provide. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to certain information from that third party service, such as your name and account information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such service.</p>

                        <p>When you access or use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you visit our Services through your computer, we automatically log your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address and approximate location information derived from your IP address, access times, browser type and language, and the website you visited before navigating to our Services.
